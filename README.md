### üîß Rule Evaluation Examples

The segment evaluation endpoint supports various rule formats:

**Numeric Comparisons:**
- `"price > 100"` - Products with price greater than 100
- `"stock_quantity <= 10"` - Products with low stock
- `"price >= 50 && price <= 200"` - Products in price range

**String Comparisons:**
- `"category == 'Electronics'"` - Products in Electronics category
- `"stock_status == 'instock'"` - Products in stock
- `"title.includes('Premium')"` - Products with 'Premium' in title

**Boolean Comparisons:**
- `"on_sale == true"` - Products on sale
- `"on_sale == false"` - Products not on sale

**Array Operations:**
- `"tags.includes('featured')"` - Products with 'featured' tag
- `"tags.length > 2"` - Products with more than 2 tags

### üö® Error Responses

**400 Bad Request:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Invalid request format",
  "details": [

```
## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This project consists of multiple microservices:

- **Product Service** (Port 4000): Manages product data and syncs with WooCommerce
- **Main Service** (Port 5000): Handles segment evaluation and rule processing
- **Frontend** (Port 3000): Next.js application with shadcn/ui components
- **Cron Service**: Automated product synchronization every 20 seconds

## üß† AI Usage & Development Notes

### AI Tools Used

**Windsurf Cascade**: Used for initial project scaffolding and boilerplate generation with the following prompt:

> Create a monorepo project called "microservices-app" using TypeScript for all services. The app includes three microservices:
> 
> 1. **product-service**: TypeScript + Node.js + Express + Prisma, WooCommerce ingestion, PostgreSQL storage
> 2. **segment-service**: TypeScript + Node.js + Express, rule-based filtering from product-service  
> 3. **frontend**: TypeScript + React or Next.js, displays product cards and accepts segmentation rules
> 
> Also generate: docker-compose.yml, Prisma schema, .env.example files, README with usage instructions
> Use Node.js 18+, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Docker

### AI Contributions
- Generated monorepo structure and microservice boilerplate
- Created Docker configuration and Prisma schema
- Built frontend scaffolding with shadcn/ui components
- Implemented rule-based textarea input and product card UI

### Manual Development & Enhancements
- Extended service logic for real WooCommerce data integration
- Improved error handling and environment variable management
- Enhanced UI/UX with better styling and user feedback
- Refined rule parser for robust segment evaluation
- Deployed services to cloud platforms (Vercel, Render)
- Created detailed documentation and setup instructions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- Docker (optional)
- WooCommerce API credentials

### Environment Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sahil-sahu/convert_cart_assignment
   cd convertcart_assignment
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm run install:all
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create `.env` file in `services/product-service/`:
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/convertcart"
   WOOCOMMERCE_URL="your-woocommerce-site-url"
   WOOCOMMERCE_CONSUMER_KEY="your-consumer-key"
   WOOCOMMERCE_CONSUMER_SECRET="your-consumer-secret"
   ```

   Create `.env.local` file in `frontend/` (optional):
   ```env
   NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Using npm (Development)

```bash
# Build all services
npm run build

# Start all services
npm start
```

This will start:
- Product Service on http://localhost:4000
- Main Service on http://localhost:5000  
- Frontend on http://localhost:3000
- Cron service for automated sync

#### Option 2: Using Docker Compose

```bash
# Build and start all services
docker-compose up --build
```

#### Option 3: Development Mode

```bash
# Run in development mode with hot reload

## üê≥ Docker Support

The project includes Docker support with multi-service orchestration:

```bash

docker-compose up -d

# Stop all services
docker-compose down
```

## üìä Database

- **ORM**: Prisma with Postgres
- **Migrations**: Automatic schema management
- **Models**: Product, Category, Tags

## üîÑ Automated Sync

The cron service automatically syncs products from WooCommerce every 20 seconds to keep data fresh.

- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Components**: shadcn/ui
- **State Management**: React hooks
- **Build Tool**: Turbopack

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port conflicts**: Ensure ports 3000, 4000, and 5000 are available
2. **WooCommerce connection**: Verify API credentials and URL
3. **Build errors**: Run `npm run clean` and rebuild

### Logs

Check service logs for debugging:
```bash
# View all service logs
docker-compose logs -f

# View specific service logs
docker-compose logs -f product-service
```
